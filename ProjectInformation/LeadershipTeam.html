As Project Director, Mingo designed and facilitated the program’s strategic implementation through the utilization of a collective impact framework at multiple locations across the Commonwealth of Virginia collaborating with local county and city governments, faith-based organizations, and community-based non-profit partners to help establish a state-wide framework to educate, empower, and economically stabilize parents and their families. The aim of the program was to improve the immediate and long-term health, behavioral and educational outcomes of pregnant and parenting teens and young adults (custodial and non-custodial parents) and members of their households to build capacity for whole-family thriving.
          </p>

          Lisa Tobe, Stronger<sup>2</sup> Senior Project Advisor
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Lisa Tobe serves as the Stronger<sup>2</sup> Senior Project Advisor, working to align all aspects of the project, provide technical assistance with Office of Minority Health Guidance and strategic insight into community capacity-building. The executive director of Wildflower Consulting, she earned a master’s degree in public health from the University of North Carolina and has worked nationally in urban and rural settings – from small nonprofit organizations to the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness’ innovative Center for Health Equity. Lisa’s 30-year career has been shaped by professional experience - and a series of "aha” moments.         
        </p>
        <p>
          A common denominator has been developing a vision for community-based programming and pursuing it through design and implementation.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Her first “aha” moment came while teaching GED classes in Appalachia. She recognized poor health – and its link to inequitable distribution of social, economic, and educational opportunities, what graduate school later called “social determinants of health.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As a health strategist and agency leader in California, she got another “aha” lesson in the urgent need for cross sector collaboration among government agencies, community-based organizations, and community members themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as the director of Louisville’s Center for Health Equity, she worked on charting community health measures by race, income, and neighborhood for the first time. Results were stark: average life spans were sharply lower in many low-income areas. In a parallel tract, Lisa led the Operationalization of Health Equity Practice Initiative – a major strategic leadership and organizational culture change program, which applied a health equity framework to a staff-led, community-engaged organizational strategic planning process. 
        </p>
        <p>
          That work intensified her commitment co-create initiatives, practices and policies that address structural issues and transform health outcomes. Lisa founded Wildflower Consulting, LLC with the belief that all people could flourish if they had equal opportunities to the right conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lisa has worked nationally in rural and urban areas providing consulting services, technical assistance, and staff support to diverse community-based not-for-profit organizations; state and local governmental agencies; national capacity-building entities and foundations. With a focus and implementing systems and environmental change, she has vast knowledge and skills in organizational and community capacity building; resource development; program development and oversight; community-driven strategic planning; evidence-based public health practice; policy advocacy; community engagement; cross-sector collaboration; facilitation; and evaluation.
